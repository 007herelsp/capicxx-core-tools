  "body": "### Welcome to CommonAPI C++!\r\nCommonAPI C++ is a C++ framework for interprocess and network communication. The basic objective is not to provide a new mechanism for interprocess or network communication (IPC), but to define a high-level C ++ API, which can be used for different mechanisms. The benefit for C ++ developers should be that they are relieved from details of proprietary or little-known communication frameworks or protocols.\r\n\r\nCommonAPI C++ is strongly related to the interface description language Franca IDL (see [Franca IDL](https://github.com/franca/franca) ). The basic procedure is that you define an interface for your service with the platform- and programming-language-independent Franca IDL. Then you generate proxy- and stub-code with the CommonAPI code generator (CommonAPI-Tools). After that implement the stub functions by using the function bodies as they are generated and then implement the client by calling these functions by using the generated proxy. To get executable applications (client and service) generate IPC framework specific code (glue-code) with the binding specific code generator (at the moment there is one for D-Bus and for SOME/IP, see details in the provided documentation). At the end compile it together with the provided runtime libraries (for CommonAPI itself and again a binding specific library, for details see again the provided documentation).\r\n\r\n### Basic Features\r\n\r\n* Interface description with the easy to learn, human-readable FrancaIDL.\r\n* Support of Franca features as inheritance, polymorphic structs, unions. \r\n* Code generation for clear and not too complex C++ code.\r\n* Actual support for D-Bus (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) and SOME/IP (see http://some-ip.com/).\r\n* High performant implementation by using C++ templates (runtime-performance).\r\n* Highly configurable for the integration on different platforms (e.g. main-loop support, support of Franca deployment files).\r\n* Multithreading support (thread-safe).\r\n\r\n",
